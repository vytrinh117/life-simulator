# Save Migration Notes


## Phase 3B COMPLETE — final migration validation (3B.5)

- Final 3B.5 does not add a new randomizing migration layer. It validates the existing deterministic 3B.1–3B.4 migration chain and fixes only a People/Profile descriptor fallback outside save semantics.
- Save/reload and repeated migration preserve canonical `p.love` state, one-sided Player crush vs NPC attraction, mutual/official/ex history, relationship start/end dates, romance milestones, H3 Decision Ledger records, scheduled date plans, matchmaking offers, and stable introduced-candidate identities.
- Repeated migration remains idempotent: no duplicate decision/matchmaking records, no randomly created attraction, no random partner creation/deletion, and no conversion of one-sided crushes into mutual romance.
- Final representative fuzz covered ages 14, 17, and 25 with 600 randomized romance/migration/initiative operations and passed save/load + repeated-migration invariants.
- Existing saves remain on the current `lifeSim_v7_world` storage architecture; Phase 3B finalization does not change the save key.

## Phase 3B.2 — Scheduled Romance Dates

- Adds deterministic `migrateRomance3B2()` normalization for date/invite history and any existing romantic plan records.
- Existing saves are not given random dates, attraction, or relationship progression. Existing romantic plans keep their IDs/times/status and receive only missing safe metadata such as inviter/acceptance/activity/movement hook.
- Per-person date/invite histories are bounded and migration is idempotent. H3 Decision Ledger records remain authoritative and are not rerolled during migration.
- Existing `p.love` from 3B.1 remains canonical; 3B.2 adds history/cooldown fields to that record rather than introducing a parallel romance state.

## v6.x → v7

The game first looks for the v7 autosave key and then checks legacy Life Simulator keys. A loaded legacy save is migrated in memory and saved back as v7.

Migration adds safe defaults for:
- simulation `clock` (date + minute),
- calendar and pending decisions,
- event cooldowns and notifications,
- emotional state and milestones,
- structured inventory items,
- parent-managed savings,
- richer NPC fields,
- phone app unlocks,
- richer career/health/social fields,
- school teachers/homework/exam calendar dates.

Legacy possession arrays and weather-gear counters are converted to structured inventory records. Legacy school `Considering` contest entries are converted to actionable `Open` entries with v7 decision/event dates. Existing people, relationships, money, needs, school scores, phone ownership and history are retained wherever the old data is usable.

The original legacy browser key is not silently deleted during migration. Restart/New Life removes only known Life Simulator keys after confirmation.


## v7 → v7.1
- Save key remains `lifeSim_v7_world`; existing v7 saves migrate in place.
- `version` becomes 7.1.
- `homeAmenities` gains safe defaults for `tv`, `radio`, and `sharedComputer`.
- `permissions.dailyAccess` is added with per-day flags for TV, shared electronics, phone, and stove. Old saves without these fields receive safe defaults.
- No existing inventory, relationships, school, money, calendar, pending decisions, or life history are discarded.


## v7.1 → v7.2
- Save key stays `lifeSim_v7_world`; `version` becomes 7.2. v6.x and v7/v7.1 saves remain loadable.
- `migrate()` ends with `reconcileState('migrate')`, which repairs:
  - **Stale kindergarten decisions** at age 6+ → `Superseded` (reason "Primary school age reached"), with a journal entry. Unanswered records at ages 3–5 get an `autoDecideDate`.
  - **Exam/calendar mismatches** → the calendar follows the exam record; duplicate exam events are removed; open exams in the past are closed as Missed (silently, without a retroactive popup); future open exams on weekends move to the next school day.
  - **Orphaned calendar events** (exams wiped by the old year rollover, sessions for clubs you left, contests no longer registered) → `Cancelled`. Past active events older than yesterday → `Expired`.
  - **Legacy `S.current`** text banners → replaced by a validated context object.
  - **Events** without `expiresAt` get a response window; **notifications** get status and source fields; old exam notices expire.
  - **Homework** `Done` → `Submitted`, `Archived` → `None`. **Clubs** get attendance, leader, warnings and position fields, plus a scheduled session if missing.
  - Mis-typed conditional purchase answers → `conditionalPurchase` with a 180-day expiry.
- New containers: `S.archive` (pending / calendar / events / exams), `S.followUps`, `S.school.record`, `S.schoolHistory` and `S.family.restrictions`. Nothing in existing history is deleted. Resolved records older than ~3–4 weeks move to `S.archive`, and finished school-day records are summarized into `S.school.record`.


## v7.2 phase 2 — inventory records
`normalizeInventory()` upgrades old item records in place, deriving defaults from `data.js`:
- Adds `lifecycleType`, `quantity`, `opened`, `remaining`, `slot`, `battery`, `capacity`/`contents`, `progress`/`completions`, `freshUntil`, `timesUsed`, `useLog` and `origin` where relevant.
- Finite items that used "condition" as an amount (e.g. makeup) keep that number as `remaining`; their condition is reset to 100.
- Separate legacy records of stackable items (e.g. three snack packs) merge into one stack.
- Only one equipped item per slot is kept (the old category-based rule could leave two tops equipped).
- **Phone:** the phone inventory item becomes canonical; `S.phone.condition/model/owned/battery` are re-derived from it, and an active phone is chosen (`S.phone.activeItemId`). An owned phone with no item record gets one.
- The stale stored `currentValue` field is removed; value is computed live.
- `S.skills` and `S.practiceLog` are added with zeros. Nothing is deleted from ownership history.


## v7.2 phase 3
- `S.education.graduations` is added. Saves aged 6+ that attended kindergarten get a kindergarten graduation (year of the 6th birthday) as a milestone.
- School names that do not match the current stage are renamed (e.g. a primary pupil at "Sunrise Secondary School" → "Sunrise Primary School"). Clubs and teachers carry over only within the same school.
- Open future assessments that share a date are spread to separate school days.
- Registered school-day contests still at the old 10:00 slot move to the 13:00 in-school slot before they start.
- `S.calendarProfile` (region + per-holiday overrides) and `S.holidayLog` are added. Old `holiday-*` flags still prevent re-triggering.
- UI preferences (sub-tab per screen, log drawer open) live under a separate localStorage key `lifeSim_ui`, not in the save.


## v7.2 phase 4
- No save changes. The appearance preference lives in `lifeSim_ui.theme` (`light` | `dark` | `auto` | `life`; default `light`). Existing players without a stored preference start in Light and can switch back to Dark in one click.


## v7.2 phase 5a
- People: `firstName`, `surname`, `fullName`, `nickname`, `roleLabel`, `npcId`, `goals` are added. Legacy names like "Mia • neighbor" keep the given name (Mia) and gain a surname; `name` becomes the full name. Mom/Dad/Grandmother keep their `name` (used for address) and gain a gender-appropriate full name.
- New containers: `S.npcs` (school roster), `S.households`, `S.plans`, `S.elections`, `S.threads`, `S.outcomes`, `S.schoolRep`, `S.family.trust` (default 60), `S.school.tryouts`, `S.familyName`.
- Existing friends count as filled social slots (no duplicate "classmate" is added on load). Existing club positions not on the new ladders are mapped on the next promotion check.


## v7.2 phase 5b
- People gain romance fields lazily (`attraction`, `romanceStage`, `romanceOpen`, `boundaries`), plus `promWith`, `datingNpc`, `giftsReceived` and `movedAway` as they come up. `S.romance.partnerId` is added; the legacy `S.romance.partner` name string is kept for display.
- New containers: `S.neighborhood` (households and reputation, created on load for ages 3+), `S.groups`, `S.rivals`, `S.awards`, `S.scene` (a date or prom night in progress; resumable from the hero), `S.school.prom`, and `S.family.ruleBreaks`.
- The old romance action (which had no partner-age check) is replaced; any existing `S.romance.status` text is preserved.


## v7.3 batch A
- `S.version` → 7.3. `S.zodiac` is recalculated from `S.dob` on load, because the old calculation was wrong for many dates and the sign is now always automatic.
- Messages gain `fromId`. Older messages are linked to the sender by name and role, preferring non-family people; their `from` becomes the person's full name.
- Existing characters keep their birth year. Only new lives start in the current year.


## v7.3 batch A2
- Saves aged 18+ that are still enrolled close the school year on load: awards, a high-school graduation, and `S.school = null`.
- A prom record (`S.school.prom`) is created for the current school year on load for Grades 8–12, if its late-April date is still ahead.


## v7.3 batch G
- The school record gains `yearKey` (the academic year), `reports`, and `semExams`. A save without `yearKey` is tagged with the current academic year and keeps its grade; `S.education.gradeOffset` is stored so the next school year is exactly one grade higher.
- `S.education.highSchoolDone` marks graduation; no school is created afterwards.
- Prom pairings are stored on the NPC records as well as on people, and existing one-way pairings are kept as they are.


## v7.3 batch B–F
- New fields: `S.farm` (today's per-target action counts, reset daily), mood bookkeeping (`S.moodClock` and related), and per-subject study/advanced-exercise day markers. Existing skill and reputation values (0–100) are kept and simply displayed as levels (10 points per level).
- Grades become one-decimal numbers as soon as you study; older integer grades are unchanged.


## v7.3 batch H + I + J
- `S.weather` gains `severity` and a real 5-day `forecast`; old saves get a new forecast at the next day change. New: `S.closures` (closure dates with reasons).
- The school record gains `lateReasons`, `stayHomeAsks`, `expulsionHearing` and `probation`; the school gains `behaviorCalls`, `conf` (conference per semester) and `stayHome`.
- Per-absence caregiver talks now follow the threshold schedule (1 notice, 4 and 7 talks, 10 call, 20 meeting, 35 warning, 45 hearing) instead of a talk after every absence.


## v7.3 batch K + N + X
- People gain `tier`, `battery`, `invites`, `reliability`, `bday` (NPCs get `bday` too), `bdayWished` and `giftsReceived` lazily. New: `S.chats`, `S.callLog`, `S.whiteLies`, `S.outings`.
- Old `S.messages` are copied once into `S.chats` (`S.chatsMigrated`), after being linked to their senders.


## v7.3 batch L + M + P + Q
- New: `S.programs`, `S.trip`, `S.tripOffer`, `S.family.anniversary` and `lastTripOffer`, item `wrapped`, skill `baking`. Catalog additions: bakedCookies, cupcakes, heartCookies (not sold in the store) and heartWrap (Valentine's seasonal).
- The teen curfew changes on load (22:30–24:00 by strictness). Existing plans are unchanged.


## v7.3 batch R + S + T
- People gain `love` ({stage, progress, since}). It is derived from the existing `romanceStage` on first use: crush → one-sided/mutual by attraction, dating → Going out, partner → Boyfriend/girlfriend.
- New: `S.npcCouples` (old `datingNpc` name strings are converted when both NPCs exist and fit the age rules; otherwise cleared), `S.romance.promiseRing / spareRing / livingTogether / married`, `S.housing` (when living together), and child people from starting a family.
- The person history cap is raised from 30 to 60. The UI preference for the removed "development" tab still renders safely.


## v7.3 phase U
- New: `S.businesses` (up to 3 active). An existing `S.stall` stand is converted once (`S.stallMigrated`) and the old stall is switched off so it never sells twice.


## v7.3 phase V1
- New: `S.housing` (default: parents), `S.uniApps` (list, applied, decisions, essay, loan, choice, year), `S.uni` (enrolled, school, year, gpa), `S.finance.uniDebt`, `S.education.degree`. A save in the middle of senior year keeps any list it builds: the application record is tied to the current school year from the start.


## v7.3 phase V2
- An adult's existing simple job (from the adult job list) becomes a career job on the next day (`S.career.job.career = true` with company, level, points, salary, boss and coworker person ids, sick/leave allowances, and a month log). Teen jobs are unchanged.


## v7.3 phase V3
- `S.uniApps` gains `schEssay`, `schApplied` and `scholarship` ({pct, why}). `S.education` gains `honors`, `rankAwardAtGrad` and `tierAidEligible`, stored at high-school graduation (class rank cannot be computed after school ends).
- `S.uni` gains `semKey`, `semGpas`, `semStudy`, `lastSemGpa`, `awardWindow`, `nextSemAid`, `club`, `rankAward` and `tierAid`. A university year already in progress continues: the first semester change closes the current semester.


## v7.3 phase B1
- University data gains brochure fields and new prices. Students already enrolled keep the tuition stored when they enrolled (`S.uni.tuition`). New: `S.uni.concerts` (one annual concert per school year).


## v7.3 phase B2
- `S.uni.major` and `majorChanged`; `S.education.degree.major`. Students already enrolled are asked to declare a major on the University panel. Older degrees without a major get no career bonus.


## v7.3 phase P3
- NPCs and people gain `gender` and `orientation` (derived from the name, plus a stable per-person roll); people gain `loveKnown`. On first load (`S.identityMigrated`), people who are not into the player's gender become not romantically open (not the current partner), and incompatible NPC couples split up.


## v7.3+ Phase 1A
- No new saved fields. The household is derived from the existing `S.housing` (no housing record = living with parents). Messages already in chats keep their kind; only new messages follow the current household.


## v7.3+ Phase 1B part 1
- Contests gain `annual`, `openDate`, `closedDate`, `closedNotified`, `closedNoticeCleared`, `withdrawnDate`; new status values "Upcoming", "Registration Closed", "Withdrawn". `S.school.annual` records which annual events were published per school year. `S.inviteLog` (last 40 days).
- An unregistered contest previously marked "Missed" becomes "Registration Closed" on the next daily tick.


## v7.3+ Phase 1B part 2
- New: `S.ffSession` (kind, label, target, start, status running/paused/done, pause info, days, start snapshot, routine stats, interrupts, background, autoSoft) and `S.routine` (defaults: normal/balanced/mixed). Old saves start with no session and the default routine.


## v7.3+ Phase 2A (checkpoint 2A.2)
- Player: `looks`, `smart` (stable seeded values, generated once), `surname`/`firstName` (from `familyName`/`name`). NPCs: `looks`, `smart` (seeded, once). `S.healthState` gains `condition`, `history`, `lastRecovered` lazily; the legacy `illness` string mirrors whether you are sick.


## v7.3+ Phase 2A (complete)
- No destructive migration. New data is created lazily and once: player `looks`/`smart`/`surname`/`firstName`; NPC `looks`/`smart`; `S.healthState.condition/history/lastRecovered/lastCheckup`; school `nurse`, `nursePasses`, school-day `nurse` records and `'excused'` periods; `S.finance.medicalDebt`; calendar type `medicalFollowUp`; Pharmacy catalog items use the existing finite `remaining` (%) model. Existing `S.health` is preserved. The legacy `healthState.illness` string mirrors whether you are sick ("Unwell"/injury label) for older code paths (work call-in-sick).


## v7.3+ Phase 2B (checkpoint 2B.2)
- Relatives gain `residence` ('home'/'elsewhere'), new ones also `branch` and `roleLabel`; siblings gain `gender` once. Defaults for old saves: parents, siblings and grandparents 'home' (preserving the old implied household), aunts/uncles 'elsewhere'. New role value `younger sibling`. `S.family.sizePref`. Maternal-branch surnames are applied once (`S.familyBranchNamed`) and only to newly generated maternal relatives.


## v7.3+ Phase 2B (complete)
- `S.family.expecting` ({due, announced}), `S.family.lastBaby`, `S.family.lastSibReq`, `S.family.sibChoreHelp`; siblings gain a personality trait lazily; items gain `loanedTo` while lent. No destructive change.


## v7.3+ Phase 3A (checkpoint 3A.2)
- NPCs gain `interests`/`dislikes` (seeded once). People gain `milestones` (typed) — old saves get their importance-3 history moments copied once (`milestonesMigrated`). No other data changes.


## v7.3+ Phase 3A (checkpoint 3A.3)
- Stored tiers Friend / Good Friend → Casual Friend; `respect` defaults to 50; new people met during play get `metDate`/`metVia`/`metAt`; `friendStatus` (Old Friend / Former Friend / Contact) with `statusSince`. Existing people keep no `metDate` (no time gates for them).


## v7.3+ Phase 3A (checkpoint 3A.4)
- People gain `convThreads` (lazy) and `supportEvidence`; `S.threadAskedOn`. No migration needed.


## v7.3+ Phase 3A (checkpoint 3A.5)
- People gain lazily: `observedTraits`, `counterSeen`, `goalsKnown`/`goalsAsked`, `relStatusKnown`, `parentsKnown`, `separatedSince`. New milestone types: acquaintances, casualFriends, closeAgain, faded, reconnected (old types unchanged). No migration needed.


## v7.3+ Phase 3A (checkpoint 3A.6)
- New `S.dev` (origin, evidence, developing, emerging, histories). On every load `migrateDev` de-duplicates `S.personality`/`S.talents` and marks existing entries core / initial **only if unmarked** — idempotent; nothing is added, removed or rerolled.


## Hotfix P1.1
- Family members gain `relation` (and `gender` where implied): set at generation; for older saves converted once from the v7.1 generator's exact labels stored in `name` ("Mom", "Dad", "Grandmother", "Grandfather"). Player children get `relation:'child'`. Idempotent.


## Phase 3B.1 — Canonical Romance State + Reciprocity
- Added deterministic/idempotent `migrateRomance3B1()`. `p.love` is canonical; legacy `p.romanceStage` / `p.attraction` remain compatibility mirrors.
- A legacy plain crush migrates as Player-side one-sided interest unless an explicit mutual or established relationship already exists.
- Existing partner IDs/history are preserved; migration does not randomly create attraction or delete partners.


## Phase 3B.3 migration
- `migrateRomance3B3()` initializes bounded romance interaction-day/commitment-history state and recovers relationship start/end dates from existing canonical/global romance history where available.
- Migration is deterministic and idempotent; it does not create affection, consent, commitment, breakups, reconciliations, or milestones via RNG.
- `formerPartner` remains a historical flag. It no longer overrides a valid reconciled/current canonical romance stage; truly legacy ex records can still infer Ex when no active canonical state exists.
- Existing partner IDs, friendship state, People records, milestones, memories, relationship history, and Decision Ledger records are preserved.

## Phase 3B.4 migration
- Added deterministic/idempotent `migrateRomance3B4()` chained after 3B.3 migration.
- `S.romance.matchmaking` preserves bounded offer/history data, statuses, candidate/matchmaker IDs, reconsideration dates, and normal-date plan links across save/reload.
- Duplicate offer IDs are removed deterministically and dangling `matchmakingOfferId` pointers are cleared; migration does not roll new candidates, attraction, or relationship outcomes.
- Introduced candidates are stable People records. Clear rejection remains remembered; Maybe Later remains eligible only after its recorded reconsideration date.
- NPC orientation compatibility now uses stable `npcId || personId`, preventing a wrapper-ID change during introduction from changing seeded compatibility.
